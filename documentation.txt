1- List Installed Packages With Pip:
    Both  pip list  and  pip freeze  will generate a list of installed packages,
    just with differently formatted results. Keep in mind that  pip list  will list 
    ALL installed packages (regardless of how they were installed).
    while  pip freeze  will list only everything installed by Pip.
2-  pip install -r requirements.txt:
    to install all the packages (dependencies) listed in the requirements.txt

3 - In practice, a module usually corresponds to one .py file containing Python code.

4- In practice, a package typically corresponds to a file directory containing Python files
 and other directories. To create a Python package yourself, you create a 
 directory and a file named __init__.py inside it. The __init__.py file
 contains the contents of the package when itâ€™s treated as a module. It can be left empty.

 5- HOW TO USE PYCODESTYLE:
    - pycodestyle --first optparse.py
    - pycodestyle --show-source --show-pep8 testsuite/E40.py
