1- List Installed Packages With Pip:
    Both  pip list  and  pip freeze  will generate a list of installed packages,
    just with differently formatted results. Keep in mind that  pip list  will list 
    ALL installed packages (regardless of how they were installed).
    while  pip freeze  will list only everything installed by Pip.
2-  pip install -r requirements.txt:
    to install all the packages (dependencies) listed in the requirements.txt

3 - In practice, a module usually corresponds to one .py file containing Python code.

4- In practice, a package typically corresponds to a file directory containing Python files
 and other directories. To create a Python package yourself, you create a 
 directory and a file named __init__.py inside it. The __init__.py file
 contains the contents of the package when itâ€™s treated as a module. It can be left empty.

 5- HOW TO USE PYCODESTYLE:
    - pycodestyle --first optparse.py
    - pycodestyle --show-source --show-pep8 testsuite/E40.py

6- cut -c 10,18 : cut the two character 10 and 18.

7- The dir function returns a list of all the attributes and methods defined on any Python object.

8- In Python3, all classes implicitly inherit from the built-in object base class

9 - It's possible to add a new attribute to a class object after its instantiation:
        simply like this : green.next_color = 'red'(for an instance of a class , not the class itself)

10 - We can delete any attribute of a class object using the del statement:
        like this: del yellow.color(only for an object of the class, not the whole class)

11 - Class and Instance Variables
        The difference between class and instance variables is where their values were assigned in a 
        class definition, which also determines the scope of the variables.

        Class variables: assigned in the class declaration but outside any method definition 
        (including the class constructor). They are related to all object instances of that class.
        Instance variables: assigned inside a class method or constructor definition. They are unique 
        to each object instance of that class.

12 - The all() function returns True if all elements in the given iterable are true. If not, it returns False.

Example
boolean_list = ['True', 'True', 'True']

# check if all elements are true
result = all(boolean_list)
print(result)

# Output: True

13 - The join() method returns a string created by joining the elements of an iterable by the given string separator.
        - string.join(iterable)

14 - Data abstraction in python
Abstraction is an important aspect of object-oriented programming. In python, we can also perform data hiding
by adding the double underscore (___) as a prefix to the attribute which is to be hidden. After this,
 the attribute will not be visible outside of the class through the object.
